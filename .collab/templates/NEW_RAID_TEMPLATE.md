# New Raid Data Template

> **Incremental Workflow**: Fill sections progressively, then use `/tttgen` output to populate Appearance/ModID data. Focus your time on gathering IDs from in-game sources.

## 👤 USER: Raid Information

**Raid Name**: 
**Raid Abbreviation**: (3-letter code, e.g., NAP, MOE, TWW)
**Release Patch**: (e.g., 12.1.0)
**Has Curio/Wildcard Token**: (Yes/No)
**Faction-Specific Tokens**: (Yes/No — if yes, which factions? If different from "ALLIANCE"/"HORDE", the code in [Core.lua](/TokenTransmogTooltips/Core.lua) will need adjustment as well.)
**Other Special Considerations**: (e.g. anything that may impact data structure generation or edge cases that haven't been covered before.)

## 👤 USER: DungeonJournal Extract Tokens Output

Open the DungeonJournal in-game with an alpha build of TokenTransmogTooltips. Navigate to the raid, select "All Classes" filter and select a Difficulty in the dropdown. Click the "Extract Tokens" button to copy the token data to your clipboard. Paste the output below. Repeat the process for each difficulty.


**Extract Tokens Output**:
```

```

## 👤 USER: /tttgen Transmog Set Appearance Data Output

With an alpha build of TokenTransmogTooltips, run `/tttgen` in the chat window. A modal will appear where you provide a "label" (usually corresponds to the raid name, cross-reference with one of the class sets in the Transmog Sets UI). After entering the label, select which gear slots have tokens and click "Generate Data". Copy the output and paste the output below:

```

```

**NOTE**: If any AppearanceId has multiple ModIds, an AUDIT block will be included in the output above. Review each AUDIT block and mark the correct ModId(s) by changing `[ ]` to `[X]`. If no ModId is marked for an AppearanceId, the `$plan` command will halt and prompt you to resolve the audit entries before proceeding.
