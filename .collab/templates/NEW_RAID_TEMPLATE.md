# New Raid Data Template

> **Incremental Workflow**: Fill sections progressively, then use `/tttgen` output to populate Appearance/ModID data. Focus your time on gathering IDs from in-game sources.

**Recommended Steps**:
1. Fill "Raid Information", "Token Groups & Class Mappings", "Difficulties", and "Token Names & Slots"
2. Run `$stub [ID]` to generate Token Item ID Mapping stubs
3. Fill "Token Item ID Mapping" from the Dungeon Journal
4. Use `/tttgen` (alpha builds) to generate raw output
5. Paste the full `/tttgen` output into the RAW OUTPUT section and mark selections with `[X]`
6. Run `$plan [ID]` → generates the PLAN OUTPUT section
7. Review PLAN OUTPUT and run `$generate [ID]` → generates code

## 📋 FILL IN: Raid Information

**Raid Name**: 
**Raid Abbreviation**: (3-letter code, e.g., NAP, MOE, TWW)
**Release Patch**: (e.g., 12.1.0)
**Has Curio Token**: (Yes/No)
**Faction-Specific Tokens**: (Yes/No — if yes, explain below)

---

## 📋 FILL IN: Token Groups & Class Mappings

Describe each token group and which classes receive it (Looking up Junk loot in the raid loot in Wowhead can help identify token groups quickly):

**Token Group 1 Name & Classes**:

**Token Group 2 Name & Classes**:

(Add more groups as needed)

---

## 📋 FILL IN: Difficulties

List which difficulties this raid supports. The Enum value will be used verbatim as the key in the generated `Difficulties` table.

**Format**: `DIFFICULTY_NAME, Enum.ItemCreationContext.Value`

**Example**:
```
RAID_FINDER, Enum.ItemCreationContext.RaidFinder
NORMAL, Enum.ItemCreationContext.RaidNormal
HEROIC, Enum.ItemCreationContext.RaidHeroic
MYTHIC, Enum.ItemCreationContext.RaidMythic
```

**⚠️ Important**: Do not modify the Enum values. They will appear exactly as written in the generated code's `Difficulties` table keys.

**Your difficulties**:
```

```

---

## 📋 FILL IN: Token Names & Slots

List each unique token name, which slot it's for, and which token group:

**Format**: `Token Name - SLOT - TOKEN_GROUP`

**Example**:
```
Vibrant Shard of the Infinite - HELM - MYSTIC
Vibrant Shard of the Infinite - SHOULDERS - MYSTIC
Corrupted Shard of the Infinite - HELM - DREADFUL
```

**Your token list**:
```

```

---

## 📋 FILL IN: Token Item ID Mapping

> **Note**: After filling the sections above, run `$stub [ID]` to auto-generate this section.

List every token ID and its details. Use this format (The Dungeon Journal is the quickest way to get item IDs and item contexts as some raids have different item IDs per difficulty and some are the same item ID with different item contexts):

```
[ITEMID] - Token Name - SLOT - TOKEN_GROUP - DIFFICULTY
```

**Example**:
```
[196658] - Vibrant Shard of the Infinite - HELM - MYSTIC - RAID_FINDER
[196661] - Vibrant Shard of the Infinite - HELM - MYSTIC - NORMAL
[196662] - Vibrant Shard of the Infinite - HELM - MYSTIC - HEROIC
[196663] - Vibrant Shard of the Infinite - HELM - MYSTIC - MYTHIC
```

**Your tokens**:
```

```

## 📋 /tttgen RAW OUTPUT

Paste the full `/tttgen` output here. Only edit by marking selections with `[X]` in the AUDIT lines.

```
=== Data for 'Raid Label' ===

## TEMPLATE
### CLASS - Set Name - Difficulty
HELM, 125672, 296659

## AUDIT
### CLASS - Set Name - Difficulty - HELM
[ ] sourceIndex=1, setID=5417, appearanceID=125672, modID=296101, name=Crown of the Fractured Tyrant
[X] sourceIndex=2, setID=5417, appearanceID=125672, modID=296659, name=Relentless Rider's Crown
```

---

## 📋 PLAN OUTPUT (Generated by $plan [ID])

> **Do not edit manually.** This section is generated from the RAW OUTPUT and your selections.

```
### TOKENGROUP - CLASS - DIFFICULTY
HELM, appearanceID, modID
SHOULDERS, appearanceID, modID
LEGGINGS, appearanceID, modID
GAUNTLETS, appearanceID, modID
```

## ✅ Data Collection Checklist

Before marking complete:

- [ ] Dungeon Journal reviewed for all tokens
- [ ] Transmog Collection UI viewed for all class sets
- [ ] /tttgen raw output pasted
- [ ] AUDIT selections marked with `[X]`
- [ ] $plan output reviewed
- [ ] Each difficulty has the same slot structure
- [ ] No duplicate token item IDs
- [ ] Single-element mod ID arrays use trailing comma: `{modID,}`
- [ ] All sections above filled in completely

## 📝 Notes

Document any special cases:

- Faction-specific tokens? (which IDs, which faction)
- Wildcard/Curio tokens? (cover all slots)
- Trade-up program? (cross-difficulty tokens)
- Missing data? (incomplete sets)
- Other considerations?
