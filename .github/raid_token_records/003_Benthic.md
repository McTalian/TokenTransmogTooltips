# New Raid Data Template

> **Incremental Workflow**: Fill sections progressively, then use `/tttgen` output to populate Appearance/ModID data. Focus your time on gathering IDs from in-game sources.

## 👤 USER: Raid Information

**Raid Name**: Benthic
**Raid Abbreviation**: Ben
**Release Patch**: 8.2.0
**Has Curio/Wildcard Token**: No
**Faction-Specific Tokens**: No
**Other Special Considerations**:
* This is not a raid, these tokens drop from enemies in Nazjatar Battle for Azeroth zone.
* We cannot use Dungeon Journal Extract Tokens for this content, so token IDs must be gathered manually from in-game sources (e.g. Wowhead, or datamining the game files directly).
* These tokens do not have difficulties or creation contexts.
* There are no token groups, each token can be used by all classes, but the item generated will be class-specific.
* Helm, Shoulders, Cloak, Chest, Belt, Legs, Bracers, Gloves, and Boots tokens exist. No weapons.

## 👤 USER: DungeonJournal Extract Tokens Output

Open the DungeonJournal in-game with an alpha build of TokenTransmogTooltips. Navigate to the raid, select "All Classes" filter and select a Difficulty in the dropdown. Click the "Extract Tokens" button to copy the token data to your clipboard. Paste the output below. Repeat the process for each difficulty.


**Extract Tokens Output**:
```
-- Manual data entry (sourced from Wowhead)
-- Format: [ITEMID] - Token Name - SLOT - Source
-- Note: No difficulties or item creation contexts. Each token is used by all classes but generates class-specific items.

## 👤 USER: /tttgen Transmog Set Appearance Data Output

With an alpha build of TokenTransmogTooltips, run `/tttgen` in the chat window. A modal will appear where you provide a "label" (usually corresponds to the raid name, cross-reference with one of the class sets in the Transmog Sets UI). After entering the label, select which gear slots have tokens and click "Generate Data". Copy the output and paste the output below:

```

```

**NOTE**: If any AppearanceId has multiple ModIds, an AUDIT block will be included in the output above. Review each AUDIT block and mark the correct ModId(s) by changing `[ ]` to `[X]`. If no ModId is marked for an AppearanceId, the `/plan-token` command will halt and prompt you to resolve the audit entries before proceeding.

## 📋 PLAN OUTPUT (Generated by `/plan-token` [ID])

> **Do not edit manually.** This section is generated from the data you provided above. Review the token group mappings and slot/difficulty assignments before proceeding to `/generate-token`.
